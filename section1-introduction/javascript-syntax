JavaScript syntax

* syntax is the way a programming language is written

* API - Application Programming Interface - every language has its own API. Collection of functions and properties.

* APIs inside APIs - jQuery is an API, has its own collection of functions and properties. Known as an embedded or extension API. jQuery uses native JavaScript API/library.

* every programming language has a compiler that takes human readable code, and compiles it into bytes. Each compiler has its own native API (functions and properties).
